# With Gemini, we define the tool definitions as a dictionary/list for easier management
# but we will actually bind the REAL functions in the Orchestrator.

# We just keep the names here for reference if needed, 
# or you can leave this file empty/unused if we bind directly in Orchestrator.
# For consistency, let's keep the tool names constant.
